## 🚀 Getting Started

### Simple Setup
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. No build process or dependencies required!

### Local Development
```bash
# If you want to serve locally (optional)
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Ball Physics
- **Initial speed**: 5 units/frame
- **Speed increase**: +0.5 units after each paddle hit
- **Maximum speed**: 12 units/frame
- **Spin effects**: Ball curve based on paddle hit position

### AI Behavior
- **Predictive movement** on higher difficulties
- **Reaction delays** for realistic gameplay
- **Difficulty scaling** affects speed and accuracy

### Scoring System
- **Win condition**: First to 11 points
- **High score tracking** with timestamp
- **Game statistics**: Time played, final scores

## 🎨 Customization

The game is highly customizable through the `CONFIG` object in `game.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    CANVAS: { WIDTH: 800, HEIGHT: 500 },
    PADDLE: { WIDTH: 10, HEIGHT: 100, SPEED: 6 },
    BALL: { SIZE: 16, INITIAL_SPEED: 5, MAX_SPEED: 12 },
    GAME: { WIN_SCORE: 11, FPS: 60 },
    COLORS: { /* Custom color scheme */ }
};
```

## 🐛 Browser Support

- ✅ **Chrome** 60+ (Recommended)
